This is a personal project so I will generally only take updates from my own account, but you are welcome to take the bot and do what you want with it :) I will merge interesting and cool changes. 

Keep code clean and solving problems / on the topic of a small TTS bot / voice call bot, this doesn't need to calculate primes as well :)
