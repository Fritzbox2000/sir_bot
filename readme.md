# SirBot

## Overview

This is a bot for adding the "aHaleAndHeartySir" voice from the novelai tts

It is designed for just my private discord server, so I'm relying on the
discord being dead enough that whatever server runs this bot to not get rate
limited.

## TODO / Dev work

At the moment the bot only will use "aHaleAndHeartySir" voice, but it might be
nice for users to be able to use other voices, although I think I will default to
sir

I could rate limit on my end, due to it only being on one server it might be a single
thread kind of problem, this would make things easier, and lower the likelyhood of
worriyng about ratelimits but good practice on writing a multithreaded thing, I will
need to design stuff but that's a problem for later Jemma

Looking at using serenty for the discord side, this will probably take a bit of
working
